This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/), written in javascript using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).


## Running solutions
to run any puzzle solution, cd into its directory and run
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```


## Questions?
If you have any questions regarding my solution, please open an issue and ask away!
I'll try to answer them as good as i can.
Beginner questions are very much welcome too.


## Notice
Note that i picked up Node.js literally 1 week before writing this, so don't expect my solutions to be overly complex (or me following best practice, for that matter).
